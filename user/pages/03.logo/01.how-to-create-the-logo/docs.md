The logo for the Corporation template uses a combination of an image and text in a custom html module published to the logo position.

The markup used for the logo in this template is as per the following:

	<h2><a href="../"><img src="images/logo/Mountain-Icon.svg.png" alt="Corporation" />Corporation</a></h2>
	<p><em>Cras nec lorem eget ligula varius lore ipsum dolor.</em></p>
	
Images published to the logo position are designed to sit to the left of any text displayed in the custom html.

The logo used on the demo can be downloaded from <a href="http://bambootheme.com/showcase/oct15/images/logo/Mountain-Icon.svg.png">here</a>.
