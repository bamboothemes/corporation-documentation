## What is this?
The offcanvas position is a module position and responsive menu that is hidden off the page (either to the left or the right) and is displayed on the page when the user clicks on the offcanvas trigger button.

## Offcanvas Trigger
The trigger for the offcanvas will automatically appear if a module is published to the offcanvas position or you have selected the offcanvas option as the menu for small screens (See the screenshot below).
