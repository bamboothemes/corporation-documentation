<h2>Where do the images come from?</h2>
<p>The template automatically lists the images located in the main images folder on your site and makes them available for use in the background. Images can be uploaded to this folder either via ftp or the <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Help34:Content_Media_Manager">Joomla media manager</a>.</p>";
