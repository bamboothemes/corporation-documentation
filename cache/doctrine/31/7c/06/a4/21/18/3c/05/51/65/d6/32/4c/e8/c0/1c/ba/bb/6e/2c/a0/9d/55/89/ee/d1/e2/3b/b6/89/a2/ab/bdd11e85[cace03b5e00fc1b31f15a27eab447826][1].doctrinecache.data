s:1194:"<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>All Zen Grid Framework v4 themes have the ability to render the main menu as a one page menu that allows the user to smooth scroll to the specific row of modules on the page.</p>
<p><img src="/docs/ascent2/images/one-page/one-page-menu.jpg" alt="Onepage menu" /></p>
<p>When one page mode is enabled the main menu content is overridden and the one page menu is rendered.</p>
<h2>Where are the menu titles for the one page menu set?</h2>
<p>The titles for the one page menu are found in the menus panel of the template settings under the one page section.</p>
<p>In order for a menu item to be visible on the page you need to ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a module published to the corresponding row. eg grid1, grid2, grid3 or grid4 for grid blocvk 1 row.</li>
<li>The menu for that row has a title for the menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the screenshot below you can see that gridblock 1 does not have a menu item specified and even though there may be a module published to any of the positions on grid1, grid2, grid3 or grid4 that menu item will not render on the page. </p>
